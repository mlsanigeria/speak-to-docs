# **Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge 2.0**

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge 2.0 organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Community! We're thrilled to have you on board for this exciting journey of collaboration and open-source contributions.

## **About the Challenge**

This challenge focuses on two main tracks:

1. **Speech-Enabled RAG Solution**: A project leveraging Microsoft Azure AI Services to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution where users can upload any document and interact with it through audio. The system allows for both audio input and audio responses, providing a seamless voice-based interaction with your documents.

2. [**Crime Trend and Fatalities Prediction in Nigeria**](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/nigeria-crime-trends): This project aims to analyze crime trends in Nigeria and build one machine learning model to predict crime-related fatalities. Participants will perform a full analysis of the dataset from [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/), including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building. An existing analysis at the Africa level can be used as a reference for participants. You can check out the notebook here for ideas on how to conduct a comprehensive analysis for Nigeria.
